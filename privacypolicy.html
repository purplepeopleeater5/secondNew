  <h1>Nutmeg – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: July 16, 2025</em></p>
  <p>Hi! I’m a solo developer who believes your data is yours. This privacy policy explains what I collect (and don’t), and how your data is handled when you use this app.</p>

  <h2>🔒 What I Collect</h2>
  <h3>If you use the free version:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Nothing personally identifiable.</li>
    <li>Optional crash reports may be sent to me (used to fix bugs). You can disable this in settings.</li>
    <li>Anonymous analytics may be received through Apple (if you opt in).</li>
    <li>Import failures (URLs that don’t work when adding recipes) are saved anonymously to help me improve support for those sites. They are not tied to you or your account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If you use Premium and create an account:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Your email and password are securely stored to sync your data across devices.</li>
    <li>Your recipes, folders, and settings are stored on Nutmeg’s servers.</li>
    <li>Your purchase information (like subscription status) is handled by RevenueCat. I don’t see or store your payment details.</li>
    <li>Passwords are hashed (encrypted), never stored in plain text.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>✅ How I Use This Info</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide syncing, backups, and multi-device support</li>
    <li>To fix crashes or bugs (if you enable crash reporting)</li>
    <li>To improve site import compatibility</li>
    <li>To restore purchases or manage your subscription</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>I do not sell or share your data. I don’t run ads or track you across apps or websites.</strong></p>

  <h2>🔐 How I Keep It Safe</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your password is encrypted using strong, industry-standard hashing</li>
    <li>All server communication uses HTTPS</li>
    <li>Data is stored on secure servers with restricted access</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔗 Third-Party Integrations</h2>
  <p>Nutmeg integrates with Pinterest via the Pinterest API. When you connect your Pinterest account, you grant access through OAuth. We only request permission to read your boards and the external URLs of your pins to import recipe links. We do <strong>not</strong> store your Pinterest credentials; the access token is stored securely on your device. You can revoke Pinterest access at any time in the app’s settings.</p>
  <p>We do not share your personal information with Pinterest beyond what you explicitly choose to share via the integration (board IDs and pin links).</p>

  <h2>👶 Children</h2>
  <p>This app is not intended for children under 13. I don’t knowingly collect data from anyone under that age.</p>

  <h2>⚖️ Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>View or delete your data any time in-app, in Settings &gt; General &gt; Delete All Data button at the bottom</li>
    <li>Delete Premium Account data at Settings &gt; Account &gt; Delete Account or contact me and I will delete it for you!</li>
    <li>Turn off crash reporting if you don’t want any data sent</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you’re in the EU, UK, or California, you're also entitled to request access to your data, correction, deletion, or portability under local privacy laws.</p>

  <h2>📬 Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, or want to delete your account or data, email: <a href="mailto:NutmegRecipes@gmail.com">NutmegRecipes@gmail.com</a></p>
