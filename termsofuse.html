        <li>We are not liable for any external content imported or viewed using this feature.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use at your own discretion.</p>

      <p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works from any part of the App unless explicitly permitted in writing.</p>
      <p>By submitting feedback or suggestions about the App, you grant us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free, irrevocable, sublicensable license to use and exploit that feedback for any purpose, without obligation to you.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Suspend or terminate your account or access if you violate these Terms.</li>
        <li>Delete user data associated with inactive or terminated accounts, in accordance with our data policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are a Premium user and terminate your subscription, access to Premium features may be revoked at the end of your billing period.</p>

      <h2 id="warranty">10. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
      <p>The App is provided “as is” and “as available.”</p>
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non‑infringement. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error‑free.</p>
      <p>We make no warranties or guarantees:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>That the App will be free from bugs, interruptions, or errors.</li>
        <li>That recipe importing will always work for third-party websites.</li>
        <li>That the App will meet your expectations or requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your use is at your own risk.</p>
      <p>Apple has no warranty or support obligations with respect to the App. In the event of any failure of the App to conform to an applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple may refund the purchase price (if any) paid for the App to you. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App.</p>

      <h2 id="liability">11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages</li>
        <li>Loss of data, loss of revenue, or business interruption</li>
        <li>Issues arising from third-party content or services</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total liability to you shall not exceed the lesser of: (i) the amount paid by you for the App in the last 30 days, or (ii) $10 USD. If applicable law does not allow this limitation, our liability shall be limited to the minimum extent permitted by law.</p>
      <p>Some jurisdictions (including certain consumer laws in California) do not allow limitations of implied warranties or exclusion/limitation of certain damages. To the extent such laws apply, some of the above limitations may not apply to you, and our liability shall be limited to the minimum extent permitted by law.</p>

      <h2 id="changes">12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We may revise these Terms at any time. If we do, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top. Continued use of the App after updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

      <h2 id="law">13. Governing Law</h2>

      <h2 id="contact">14. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or would like to request account deletion or data access:</p>

      <h2 id="apple-terms">16. Apple Terms; Licensed‑Not‑Sold & Third‑Party Beneficiary</h2>
      <p>The App is licensed, not sold, to you. Your license is non‑exclusive and non‑transferable and permits use of the App on Apple‑branded devices you own or control, subject to the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions (including Usage Rules) and any Family Sharing or volume purchasing policies that apply.</p>
      <p>These Terms are between you and us (not Apple). Apple is a third‑party beneficiary of these Terms and may enforce them against you with respect to your use of the App.</p>

      <h2 id="support">17. Maintenance & Support</h2>
      <p>We, not Apple, are responsible for providing any maintenance and support for the App. Features may change, be suspended, or be discontinued at any time in our discretion. Some improvements may be rolled out automatically via updates.</p>

      <h2 id="compliance">18. Legal Compliance (Export/Trade Controls)</h2>
      <p>You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You agree to comply with all applicable export control and sanctions laws and regulations.</p>

      <h2 id="indemnification">19. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us and our affiliates, contractors, and service providers from and against any third‑party claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your: (a) use of the App; (b) violation of these Terms; or (c) violation of any rights of another person or entity.</p>

      <h2 id="entire">20. Entire Agreement; Severability; No Waiver</h2>
      <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the App and supersede any prior or contemporaneous understandings. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision is not a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

      <h3>👩‍⚖️ Final Notes</h3>
      <p>These Terms help protect you as a user and me as a solo developer. Please use Nutmeg responsibly. Thanks for your support!</p>
